# Country Explorer

This project is built with Vue 3 and the rest countries api to explore country data.

## Recommended IDE Setup

Use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension (disable Vetur if installed).

## Project Setup

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bonnieace/country-explorer
cd country-explorer
npm install
```

### Running the Application

Start the development server with:

```sh
npm run dev
```

For a production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Design Decisions

- **Vue 3**: Chosen for fast build performance and a modern development experience.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Ensures reusability and maintainability by dividing the UI into reusable Vue components.
- **State Management**: Utilizes Pinia for state management.
- **API Integration**: Fetches data dynamically from an external API (i.e., REST Countries API) to display current country information.
- **Styling**:Implemented using Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern UI.

## Git Workflow

I followed a structured Git workflow to version control:

1. **Main Branch (`main`)**: Contains stable, production-ready code.
2. **Feature Branches (`feature/<name>`)**: Created for new features and improvements.
3. **Merging Process**:
   - Create a feature branch from `main`.
   - Commit and push changes to the respective branch.
   - Merge the branch into `main`.
